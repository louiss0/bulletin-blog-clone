        The rich text element allows you to create and format headings,
        paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of
        having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily
        create content.

        How to customize formatting for each rich text Headings, paragraphs,
      </h3>
      <p>
        A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For
        static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For
        dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then
        connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!

      <p>
        blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled
        after a class is added to the rich text element using the "When inside
        of" nested selector system.
